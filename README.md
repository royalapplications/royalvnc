![RoyalVNC](Design/Banner_Rendered/Banner.png)

RoyalVNC is a modern, high performance implementation of the [VNC/RFB protocol](https://github.com/rfbproto/rfbproto/blob/master/rfbproto.rst) written in Swift.
The SDK (RoyalVNCKit) is compatible with Swift, Objective-C, and C on macOS, iOS, iPadOS, Linux and Windows.
It has no external dependencies but includes some free (public domain) third party code from the libtommath, libtomcrypt and D3DES libraries (see [Credits](#Credits)).

## Supported Features

### Misc. Features
- Support for 8-bit, 16-bit and 24/32-bit color depths with high-performance framebuffer implementations.
- Clipboard redirection support for text in both ways (remote to local and local to remote).
- Connection state management and rendering is decoupled from each other, so it's possible to build "headless" clients (ie. no rendering of the remote desktop). 
- The SDK includes a ready-to-use implementation of a framebuffer view for macOS (subclass of `NSView`), which also handles mouse and keyboard input, local cursor (`NSCursor`), scaling and rendering. The iOS/iPadOS equivalent (`UIView`) is a work-in-progress.
- First-class error handling. The `VNCError` type divides all possible errors into three broad categories: Protocol, Authentication and Connection errors. There are helper functions to retrieve human-readable descriptions for all errors and a convenience functions that allows the SDK consumer to distinguish between errors that should be displayed to the user and ones that shouldn't.
- Headless CLI demos (one using Swift and another one using the C API) are included in the repository. 
- [This repository](https://github.com/royalapplications/royalvnc-demo) contains Demo/Sample clients for macOS (one written in Swift, one in Objective-C) and iOS/iPadOS.
